                  That's why I've developed my animal husbandry and training skills for the past 16 years by 
                  completing an internationally recognised natural horsemanship training course, 
                  rehabilitating rescue dogs for Stokenchurch Dog Rescue, and caring for dogs and cats via my 
                  walking and pet sitting business, Walks and Purrs.

                <Text c="gray.7">
                  I'll ease the burden and stress caused by your fighting felines, howling hound, or peeing puppy. 
                  With my support, you'll delight in your pet's behaviour.

                  My lost bloodied, highly-strong horse aptly named Highlight unsocked me so often I had head-to-toe 
                  bruises. With every new behaviour I compassionately and humanely taught Highlight, my body more 
                  blossomed into a people-loving, confident companion.

                <Text c="gray.7">
                  That's why I only use gentle, positive training methods while providing effective dog, puppy, cat, 
                  or kitten behavioural solutions.

                  Experience the freedom that comes from sharing life with an animal that happily makes good choices while 
                  retaining the fun personality you fell in love with â€” just like I do with my Highlight.
